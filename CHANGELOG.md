## 2016-03-14 - v1.0.0
### Summary

* Sonatype is now releasing initial versions of Nexus IQ without a revision
  number in the bundle name. A fix was put in place to flag if the revision
  number should be used at all

* Bump to version 1.0.0 - While bumping to v0.1.3 would be valid, at this point
  There aren't extra features that are known to be missing so it seems apropos
  to call this as having reached a 1.0.0 status.

## 2015-10-27 - v0.1.2
### Summary

  1.17.0. This updates the module to handle the package name changes
